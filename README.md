# Quick JS
A powercord plugin that compiles different snippets that don't have to be solo plugins.

* Snippets are there because it would just take more space if it was it's own plugin. It's much easier to use one plugin.
* You can choose which snippets are available at a given time.
* Suggest your own snippets you want to see included in the [correct issue](https://github.com/12944qwerty/quick-js/issues/1)


## Current Snippets
